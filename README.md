This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving type coercion and unexpected string concatenation.  The `foo` function intends to add numbers, but due to JavaScript's dynamic typing, it performs string concatenation when one or both arguments are strings.  The solution shows how to explicitly type-check the arguments or use a more robust approach to handle different data types.
